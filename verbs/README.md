# verbs

Initial prototype functionality for conjugating Johnson's verbs.

Some messy code in VerbConjugationLogic - to be tidied up and moved into the verb conjugators.

Lots of logic branches - some with inclusions for suffices - could be negated to use exclusions instead.

I plan on re-working this logic with the aim of obtaining the simplest logic to conjugate regular verbs.
